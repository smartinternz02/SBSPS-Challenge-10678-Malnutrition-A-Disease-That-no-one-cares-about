IBM HACK CHALLENGE 2023                                                                                                                                                             

Examining Malnutrition And It's Types To Make People Aware Of It                                                                                                                    
Malnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients. The term malnutrition covers 2 broad groups of conditions. One is ‘undernutrition’—which includes stunting (low height for age), wasting (low weight for height), underweight (low weight for age) and micronutrient deficiencies or insufficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals). The other is overweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer).
                             Utilize the Cognos analytics platform to perform data analysis and generate insights. Develop visualizations using the built-in tools and capabilities provided by Cognos to present the findings effectively. This step may involve creating dashboards, charts, and reports to visualize key metrics and trends related to malnutrition.

 OUTCOMES OF PROJECT
   - Conduct statistical analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the collected data.
   - Develop interactive visualizations using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present the analysis findings in a clear and understandable manner.
   - Create dashboards and reports to provide stakeholders with real-time insights on malnutrition prevalence, risk factors, and consequences.
   - Utilize the collected data to assess the extent and severity of malnutrition in the target population.
   - Identify specific malnutrition types (wasting, stunting, underweight, overweight) prevalent in different demographic groups.
   - Analyze the nutritional status of vulnerable groups such as children, pregnant women, and elderly individuals.
